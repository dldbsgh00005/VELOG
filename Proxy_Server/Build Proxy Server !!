### Let's Build Proxy Server


1. Install Squid Windows Version

2. cd to installed directory  >> ( gernerally , C:\Squid\etc\squid\squid.conf ) , check it out

3. open txt or editor , then edit  >> squid.conf

4. set port configuration  >> http_port 3128

	if wanna fix it, try http_port [port_number_you_want]    ( ex : 8080 ) 

5 . set access control >> [ip_you_wanna let access] ( ex: acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24)

6. Start Squid Service !!
	
	way 1)

  	Press >> Windows + R
	
	find "Squid" and push Right Button of Mouse , and select Start

	way 2) 
	
	at CMD , write down this command line, >>> net start squid    ( I think this is way better than former one ) 

7. set the firewall configuration

	step 1. Windows + R , execute wf.msc so there you go, Windows firewall is opened, for sure, it should be,

	step 2. add new rule to "INBOUND RULES" , so you can admit port, used for Squid ( ex: 3128 or 8080 , stuff like that)

8. Proxy Server Test

	step 1. At Browser Network Setting, let use proxy

	step 2. for IP address , localhost or Local Server IP,     
	         for Port , input the port from Squid

	step 3 . open the webpage, and check out whether proxy server is working or not


so got to the end of the proxy server project, congratulation~~~~~~~
